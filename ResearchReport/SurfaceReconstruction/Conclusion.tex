\section{Conclusion}

We presented a new method to reconstruct a surface from a point cloud, in the form of a depthmap. 
By taking advantage of the implicit connectivity between pixels of a depthmap (which represents points that have been acquired), we are able to recover the surface underlying the point cloud.
This implicit connectivity also allows to approximate geodesics through the point cloud, by considering the depthmap as a graph, where edges are weighted by the 3D euclidean distance of neighboring points.
Using that, a surfacic Voronoi diagram can be computed, whose dual representation creates a base mesh, a coarse approximation of the point cloud.
By recursively sudviding triangles of this mesh, we generate a progressive structure allowing to display a mesh at different levels of resolution.
